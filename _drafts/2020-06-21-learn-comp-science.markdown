This is a difficult thing to admit to myself. Even though I've loved computer, programs and writing them for better half of my life, my formal education in computer science has been the first two intro classes back in college. This [post](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) on explaining **why learn computer science** particularly reasonated with me:

> There are 2 types of software engineer: those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, innovative work, and those who just get by because they’re familiar with a few high level tools.
> 
> Both call themselves software engineers, and both tend to earn similar salaries in their early careers. But Type 1 engineers progress toward more fulfilling and well-remunerated work over time, whether that’s valuable commercial work or breakthrough open-source projects, technical leadership or high-quality individual contributions.

I love solving problems, I love working on concurrent, performant code. Even then, what I've been reading and learning are still like instagram photos and tweets - scattered and piecemeal. While I like to see myself as the "Type 1 engineer", I need to make sure I have the foundations to continue to do so. To fix this problem, I must first admit to myself that I have a problem.

### The Plan

I have the luxury of having a job that actually works with complex, parallel and throughput-critical programs in a wide variety of language levels (FPGA, C/C++, C#, and Python/R). I plan on following the [Teach yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) curriculum, but modified it to first focus on topics that have relevant applications for me in the following order.

#### 1. Distributed Systems (est time Q2-Q3 of 2020)
- [ ] finish "Distributed Systems" lecture series [MIT 6.824 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQP8WApzIQQ&list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB)
- [ ] complete lab assignments here: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/
- [ ] read the book "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann


#### 2. Computer Networking (Q3-Q4 of 2020)
- [ ] finish video lecture series here [Introduction to Computer Networking](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvFG2xYBrYAQCyz4Wx3NPoYJOFjvU7g2Z)
- [ ] Read the book "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition)"
- [ ] For server: implement a simple http server in C++ from scratch
- [ ] For client: implement a WebSocket chat application in React/Typescript
- [ ] For general network: setup my own VPN through a cloud provider
