Hi, I'm Bo. I work on deep learning and signal processing for DNA sequencers — the kind of software that turns raw fluorescence images into genomic data in real time. Before this, I built and led a computational team at an early-stage molecular assay platform startup, and spent five years developing super-resolution and basecalling algorithms for high-throughput sequencing instruments.

My background is in chemical engineering (Ph.D. from UT Austin, B.Sc. from the University of Alberta with a CS minor). My research was in machine learning for process control — dynamic time warping, fault detection, adaptive models — which led me to industrial data engineering before I pivoted to genomics. Along the way I've published a dozen journal papers and filed ten patents, mostly in image analysis and sequencing algorithms. You can find the full list on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-4OgD_EAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1).

I learn best by building things from scratch and then writing about them. That's how this blog ended up with a [5-part series on building a deep learning framework](/deep-learning-scratch-part1-tensors/), a [visual guide to XGBoost internals](/xgboost-visual-guide-part1-theory/), an [autodiff engine in Rust](/autodiff-rust-part1-graphs/), and a deep dive into [the science of cancer screening](/cancer-testing-landscape/). The topics jump around — C++ template metaprogramming one month, Bayesian statistics the next — but the thread is always the same: pick something I don't fully understand, dig until I do, and write it up clearly enough that it sticks.

If you have feedback on anything here, I'd genuinely like to hear it.
