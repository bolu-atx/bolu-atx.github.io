Hi, I'm Bo. I studied process control and machine learning in school - I wrote some papers on dynamic time warping, variable selection and feature engineering, latent variable projection based algorithms, and growing self-organizing maps for modeling semiconductor processes. For further details, visit my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-4OgD_EAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1). 

My work currently involves developing large-scale high performance image analysis and real-time machine learning pipelines for Illumina's sequencers. We use a lot of C++, but I also work on prototyping stuff in Python/bash/C#.

 I am passionate about technology, computer science, and various geek topics. In my spare time, I enjoy learning about new technology, build web apps and taking landscape photos.

I started this blog to try to document my curiosities into various CS related topics in a little bit more structured format. I also wanted to take this opportunity to improve my technical writing. If you have any feedback on any of the work here, they are very much appreciated.
