Hi, I'm Bo. I build software and algorithms for systems that deal with the real world — sequencers, assay platforms, and reactors. I like the part where math on a whiteboard turns into something that ships in a real instrument. My background wanders through chemical engineering, process control, industrial ML, and genomics.

I learn best by building things from scratch and then writing about them. The topics jump around — C++ template metaprogramming one month, Bayesian statistics the next — but the thread is always the same: pick something I don't fully understand, dig until I do, and write it up clearly enough that it sticks.

If you have feedback on anything here, I'd genuinely like to hear it.
