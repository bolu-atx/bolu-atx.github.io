Hi, I'm Bo. I am a software developer / bioinformatics scientist at a San Diego based biotech start-up. I build scalable high performance software in signal processing pipelines of molecular diagnostic instruments. I previously worked at Illumina, building algorithms and softwares for DNA sequencers.

I studied dynamic systems, optimization and process control of these systems - I wrote some papers on dynamic time warping, feature engineering for building large and robust ML models on process systems, and proposed several novel regression and classifiation model algorithms that deal with model degradation and uncertainty. For further details, visit my [Google Scholar page üßëüèª‚Äçüéì](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-4OgD_EAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1). 

I am passionate about tech, computer science, and various geeky topics. In my spare time, I enjoy learning about new technology, build web apps and taking landscape photos.

I started this blog to try to document my curiosities into various CS related topics in a little bit more structured format. I also wanted to take this opportunity to improve my technical writing. If you have any feedback on any of the work here, they are very much appreciated.
