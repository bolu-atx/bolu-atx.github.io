My name is Bo (David) Lu. I studied process control and earned a degree in Chemical Engineering from University of Texas at Austin. My research now works as a bioinformatics scientist at Illumina Inc. My work focuses on developing production grade image analysis and machine learning pipelines in Illumina's next-generation sequencing platforms. I work on algorithms and on-instrument pipelines mostly in C++; but I also do prototyping and exploration in Python.

In my spare time, I enjoy learning about new technology, build web apps and taking landscape pictures.
