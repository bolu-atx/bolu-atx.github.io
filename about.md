My name is Bo (David) Lu. I studied process control and multivariate modeling in Chemical Engineering and earned a PhD degree from The University of Texas at Austin (Go Longhorns!) You can learn more about my research on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-4OgD_EAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1). I've taken a role as a bioinformatics scientist with Illumina Inc. My work involves writing image analysis and machine learning pipelines for Illumina's portfolio of sequencing platforms. I write a lot of C++ for production code, and mostly Python/bash for prototyping and exploration.

In my spare time, I enjoy learning about new technology, build web apps and taking landscape pictures.
