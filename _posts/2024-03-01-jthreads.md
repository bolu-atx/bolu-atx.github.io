`std::jthread` introduced in C++20 is a new thread class that is cancellable and joinable. It is a wrapper around `std::thread` that provides a few additional features. In this post, I wanted to talk about `std::jthread` and how it can be used in modern C++ codebases.

Advantages over C++11 `std::thread`:

- cancellable, can be stopped at any time, unlike `std::thread` which can only be stopped at the end of the thread function
- works better with `RAII` pattern, since it can be joined or detached in the destructor

### Cancellation mechanism with `request_stop`

First, let's see how to use the `std::jthread` with its stop token mechanism:

```cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <stop_token>

void foo(std::stop_token stoken) {
    while (!stoken.stop_requested()) {
        std::cout << "Running\n";
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    }
}

int main() {
    std::jthread t(foo);
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));
    t.request_stop();
    t.join();
    return 0;
}
```

As expected, this prints

```
Running
Running
Running
Running
Running

...Program finished with exit code 0
Press ENTER to exit console.
```

the `token` is implicitly passed to the thread function and can be used to check if the thread should stop. The `request_stop` method is used to signal the thread to stop. While this can be done in application code with custom flags, `std::jthread` provides a standard way to do this.

### RAII pattern

`std::jthread` works well with RAII pattern. It can be joined or detached in the destructor. This means you don't have to worry about forgetting to join a thread. Here's an example:

```cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <stop_token>

void foo(std::stop_token stoken) {
    while (!stoken.stop_requested()) {
        std::cout << "Running\n";
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    }
    std::cout << "Thread stopped\n";
}

int main() {
    {
        std::jthread t(foo);
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note the above example code, thread stop is implicitly done as soon as the parent block goes out of scope.

This will print
```
Running
Running
Running
Running
Running
Thread stopped
```


### Conclusion

`std::jthread` is a new thread class introduced in C++20 that provides a few additional features over `std::thread`. It is cancellable and joinable, and works well with RAII pattern. I prefer it over the legacy `std::thread` for projects that have the luxuary of using C++20 off the bat.
