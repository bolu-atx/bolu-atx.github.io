This is the obligatory "Hello World" post.

After various attempts to use Wordpress, Vue, React, I've decided to just switch to Github pages (Jekyll). The setup was fairly painless:

- The official Github pages guide was very helpful https://pages.github.com/
- To re-direct my custom domain (bolu.dev) to the Github pages, I followed Hossain Khan's guide here: https://medium.com/@hossainkhan/using-custom-domain-for-github-pages-86b303d3918a

The main advantage of Github pages is the ease of setup and migration should I need to do so in the future. There's no database, almost no-setup, and I can make use of standard git workflows. Looking forward to see if this motivates me to write more and document more.
