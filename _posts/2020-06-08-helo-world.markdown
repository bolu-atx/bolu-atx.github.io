After countless Wordpress, Vue, React attempts to host a blogging site, I've decided to just switch to Github pages (Jekyll). The setup was fairly painless:

- The official Github pages guide was very helpful https://pages.github.com/
- To re-direct my custom domain (bolu.dev) to the Github pages, I followed Hossain Khan's guide here: https://medium.com/@hossainkhan/using-custom-domain-for-github-pages-86b303d3918a
